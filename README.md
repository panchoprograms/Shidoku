# Shidoku Difficulty Rating
An Excel project to create a difficulty rating system for each integration of possible shidoku puzzles, the 4x4 Sudoku variant.

## Abstract

This paper is an analysis of a combinatorial number-placement puzzle named sudoku. Correctly, the variation of sudoku called shidoku is analyzed using the group's variables. The group classifies and enumerates minimal structures of the 4x4 grid puzzles. The minimal shidokus is a smaller subset of the total enumerations that gives the group a manageable set of data. Using the solutions of these puzzles, we can use a created difficulty system to assess the data based on the start of given clues. The goal of doing so is to prove that as the amount of starting clues given decreases, the difficulty of the minimal shidoku will increase on average.
